## Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
The [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) is a microcontroller, a small computer that runs a single program.

The Nano uses *3.3V* logic. Here is the pinout, a map of all general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins:

### Installing the Arduino IDE
[Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), we recommend the desktop version, which shows up as *Arduino* once installed.

The IDE (integrated development environment) is a simple tool to write, build and deploy programs.

### Getting started with the Nano
Follow this guide to [get started with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense#toc2).

Or just open *Tools > Board > Board Manager...* and add the *Arduino nRF528x Boards (Mbed OS)* package.

Then select *Tools > Board > Arduino Mbed OS Boards (nRF52840 / STM32H747) > Arduino NANO 33 BLE*

Now connect the Nano BLE 33 Sense to your computer via USB and select it in the *Tools > Port* menu.

Finally, open *File > Examples > Basics > Blink* and click the ⮕ *Upload* button.

(Driver issues? Check the guide above or try pressing reset before upload.)

### Learning the Arduino language
The [Arduino language](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) is very similar to C, libraries are written in C++.

This is *Blink*, the *Hello, World!* of embedded programming:
```
int ledPin = 13;

void setup() { // runs once
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // set up the LED pin
}

void loop() { // runs forever
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn the LED pin on
  delay(1000);                // wait for 1000ms = 1s
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // turn the LED pin off
  delay(1000);                // wait again
}
```

### Using the #MakeZurich 2020 badge
The [#MakeZurich 2020 badge](https://twitter.com/makezurich/status/1319979676459216896) has 11 individually controllable Neopixel multicolor LEDs and a [SAO](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/) connector.

Try this [Corona app scanner example](Arduino/Neno33BleSense_CoronaAppScanner/Neno33BleSense_CoronaAppScanner.ino), it requires the [Adafruit_NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) and the [ArduinoBLE library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE).

Note: Please unplug the battery before plugging the USB cable to flash the board.

### Installing a library for the Nano
